    "### 1. Problem Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "-   What is the problem you are trying to solve\n",
    "\n",
    "    The problem trying to be solved with the cost function is to find the difference between a predicted y value and a real y value. The cost or returned value is the measure of how well the model is predicting its target data.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   What kind of data are you working with?\n",
    "\n",
    "    The data being worked on is a list or numpy arrays. One is for the x values and another for the y values. They have to have gaussian distribution or be linear wether postive or negative. \n",
    "\n",
    "-   What are the goals and objectives of the project?\n",
    "\n",
    "    The goal is to develop a set of y values that will then be used to predict a random x value given. And then calculate how far away it is from the real y value\n",
    "\n",
    "-   What is the expected output of the machine learning algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "    the total cost of the predicted y value\n",
    "\n",
    "-   What are the constraints and limitations of the problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "    it is currently for 1 variable, a w and b variable need to be given\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation for cost with one variable is:\n",
    "  $$J(w,b) = \\frac{1}{2m} \\sum\\limits_{i = 0}^{m-1} (f_{w,b}(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2 \\tag{1}$$ \n",
    " \n",
    "where \n",
    "  $$f_{w,b}(x^{(i)}) = wx^{(i)} + b \\tag{2}$$\n",
    "  \n",
    "- $f_{w,b}(x^{(i)})$ is our prediction for example $i$ using parameters $w,b$.  \n",
    "- $(f_{w,b}(x^{(i)}) -y^{(i)})^2$ is the squared difference between the target value and the prediction.   \n",
    "- These differences are summed over all the $m$ examples and divided by `2m` to produce the cost, $J(w,b)$.\n",
